<center><h1>Morphing of 2 images</h1></center>
<p>
In this we have morphed 2 images by using the <strong>Beier-Neely Morphing</strong> technique. And No inbuilt Function was used in the process <br>
<center><img src="animate.gif"  "></center>
<br>
In order to achieve this we had followed the following steps.
<br>
<h2><strong>Step 1</strong></h2>
We have identified and given the tie points to the image and manually supply them in a 
text file .


<h2><strong>Step 2</strong></h2>
We have caluclated two warp images warp 0 and warp 1 for each value of t and avergae them to produce different intermediate images it depend on the value of t .
.<br>

<br>
And in the next step we have created a series of transition images to create an illustion of morphing . <br> <br>
<center>
<img src="0.1.png"	style="width:228px;height:228px;"  >
<img src="0.3.png"	style="width:228px;height:228px;"  >
<img src="0.5.png" style="width:228px;height:228px;" >
<img src="0.7.png"	style="width:228px;height:228px;"  >
</center>

These images produced with varying values of t are then used to produce a gif image which gives us an illution like the above diagram ..
