Morphing, short for metamorphosing, refers to an animation technique in which one image is gradually turned into another.  Its a transformation of one image to another by the gradual distortion of corresponding points.

The Lab assignment has two parts: 
a) Image Morphing between 2 images
Input: Given 2 images and  .txt file that specifies the tie points between these two images
Output: .gif image (exhibiting Image morphing between two images)

Some basic concepts were already discussed and you may refer to the Shared-folder for some some ppts/content on this topic. Also, you may refer to following links: https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall00/cs426/papers/beier92.pdf

There are several ways to do image morphing. If you are using Delaunay's  triangulation, you may refer to these http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html. And you are allowed to use their subroutines for generating the grid topology
